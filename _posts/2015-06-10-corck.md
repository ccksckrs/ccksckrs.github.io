### Verse 1

After one year waiting of crushing everything  
I wanna live once again to the place I've been  
After one year waiting and loosing all my flings  
I wanna feel the pain my ass suffered with my friends

### Chorus

C (I'm sick)  
Or (I'm bored)  
C (to seek)  
K (ok)  
I'm sick of seeking Corsica

### Verse 2

After one day drving and burning all my gas  
I just arrived on time to see the boat leaving  
After one nightsailing and drinking all my wine  
I'm parking near adwarf who says :  
« Your car will burn ! »

### Chorus

### Bridge

But after all this shits  
Didn't stop my motivation  
I'm starting over my trek on the promised land

### Solo

### Verse 3

After two days trekking and sleeping in the rain  
My body shivers andI really want to leave this place  
Now I am wandering :« Is this going to end ? »  
I just keep on singing this anthem again and again

### Chorus
