C.Or.C.K


After one year waiting of crushing everything  
I wanna live once again to the place I've been  
After one year waiting and loosing all my flings  
I wanna feel the pain my ass suffered with my friends

Refrain (x2) :

C (I'm sick)  
Or (I'm bored)  
C (to seek)  
K (ok)  
I'm sick of seeking Corsica

After one day drving and burning all my gas  
I just arrived on time to see the boat leaving  
After one nightsailing and drinking all my wine  
I'm parking near adwarf who says :  
« Your car will burn ! »


Refrain x2

Bridge

But after all this shits  
Didn't stop my motivation  
I'm starting over my trek on the promised land

Solo

After two days trekking and sleeping in the rain  
My body shivers andI really want to leave this place  
Now I am wandering :« Is this going to end ? »  
I just keep on singing this anthem again and again

Refrain
