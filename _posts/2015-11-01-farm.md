Cracks and traps stole the night out
Black hole noise disturbed the womb of feathers
In the dead of light where no wolves shout
Winter is but degrees doesn't fit with this weather

My wife, my son, my wood
I see them burning
My cow, my sheep
I can't see the sun
Firemen not coming
My wife, my son, my wood
I see them burning
My cow, my sheep, my life

Windy tree shakes too much for
A silent sleep I can feel something wrong in the deep
Sun's not here but it sounds bright
There I sit in the flames, with hollows, hell's on my door.

Goodbye fellas, farewell unsaid lads
I float over smoking bodies
People thought I fell under leaves
Too bad I sizzled the drum as it's softer,  softer than lands

My wife, my son, my wood, my cow
My sheep, my farm, my life
