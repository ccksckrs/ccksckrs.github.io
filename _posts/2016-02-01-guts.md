Last song we heard a little sweety pinky kiddy band
"We play punk rock !" they miserablily tried to pretend
Go back to the skatepark or the kindergarden you came from
"Twelve bucks for my album" 'd rather leave and go fuck your mom

Waspy music for waspy guys, you really don't even know who you are,
"Don't miss the candy bar" put your make up and do the poppy star
"woof woof" oh yeah "weef weef" oh no "The next one is a lovesong"
Be quiet on your safe stroll, I'm gonna show you how to rock'n roll
