Stumpin' bluesin' gamblin' the city  
In the crowd the gals look so pretty  
They turn on the fun is so easy BUT

The need for speed is soothing my baby  
Landscapes mistakes are going away  
Eatin miles I got no time to waste BUT

_Refrain:_

Got an issue.  
Kinda pain in the ass.  
I gat rocks in m'y boots  
I don't know the fuck it comes from  
But it pisses me off oh yeah !

Poll ended the campaign is fadin'  
Leaving feng shui flat for a wheeling  
Cops drawing the line I am snorting BUT

Money flow my banker go crazy  
oily boobs are bouncing around me  
Skinny asses are begging for my fist BUT

_Refrain_

PONT:
it burns my toes, and smashes my flesh,  
the pain's in my brain, it's feeding my anger,  
and that's why everyday I have to come and play rock n roll !
