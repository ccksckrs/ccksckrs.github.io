Two songs ago my farm burned away
I hit the road without any money
They grabbed my hand to put something in
A little something to be cashed in

So now I eat and vomit  every day
The whole land is plenty of loot without ashtray
Don't sniff it though you will be changed
You will be changed in a unicorn Hey hey

Feels good to eat my strange corn every day
The company gives me everything I want
I go fat, I go ill
I think I 'm gonna live happy like a pig

And if you think They talk about
Who's paying For your death ?
And if you think They talk about
Who's paying For your death
You're so fucked
You're so fucked

Let me introduce myself
I am the world bigest food manufacturer
I will feed you with poison
And you will give me your money


Monsanto...
The sue main for being smart
Killing millions (of people)
without being caught (and still are)
Breaking into your house, your fridge, your life
Using to be in slavery and now your are their slave
Looking around you, everything you love is Monsanto

Browning nose you wife flair with words
Creating agent sludge, round up, sterile coin
