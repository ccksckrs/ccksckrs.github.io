### Verse 1

On the road again  
driving my 3-0-6  
My bab's beside me  
hanging two other teens  
x2

They enter in the car  
My baby goes blank  
Stopping on the side  
She's pukin' on the wall  

### Chorus

Rock on gazolin x4

### Verse 2

After I spit on their clits  
They say "give us more!"  
But I had to go away with truckers  
x2  
But someone (someone!)  
Anywhere (anywhere!)  
Someone anywhere has to pay

### Chorus

### Solo

### Verse 3

I am a poor, I am a poor lonesome trucker  
My tank are full, I have to full peggy the whore  
But what that fool that is knocking on my door?
