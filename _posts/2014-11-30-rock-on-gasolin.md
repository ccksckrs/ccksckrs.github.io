On the road again
driving my 3-0-6
My bab'beside me
hanging two other teens
x2

They enter in the car
My baby goes blank
Stopping on the side
She's pukin' on the wall

Refrain:
Rock on gasolin x4

After I spit on their clits
They say "give us more!"
But I had to go away with truckers
x2
But someone (someone!)
Anywhere (anywhere!)
Someone anywhere has to pay

Refrain x2

I am a poor, I am a poor lonesome trucker
My tank are full, I have to full peggy the whore
But what that fool that is knocking on my door?

Cacabox x10
