Washing dishes upon my birthday's house  
You broke my heart I had to punch you right  
You keep complaining and making me angry  
I pretended to be your chosen one  
But you're still missing our dead born son  
I wanted Emily, you wanted Jason

### Refrain

Say Hello and smack (AND SMACK) the cold tining (CANT GO BACK)  
Go swim in your blood pool (BLOOD POOL)  
I'll make you dead silent (DONT WANT TO)  
Say Hello and smack (AND SMACK) the cold tining (CANT GO BACK)  
Go swim in your blood pool (BLOOD POOL)  
And make you taste the pain.... AND MAKE YOU TASTE THE PAIN  

### C2

As you're lying crying like bad babies  
I kick your head and turn on the TV  
I can't hear anything : it's making me angry  
In our neighborhood they can't blame me  
All your holes stuck guess which is your daddy  
You're just an albatros flyinng over seas
